# Factory.js

A library for create test-data factories

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sunesimonsen/factory.js.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sunesimonsen/factory.js)

## Install

You can install the Factory.js using npm the following way:

    npm install factory.js

You can require the Factory.js using require.js the following way:
``` js
define('path/to/factory', function (factory) {
    // define you're module that uses the factory
});
```

If you choose to use the library directly in the browser the factory
will be installed in the global namespace under the name:

    weknowhow.factory

## Usage

``` js
function Game(data) {
    this.id = data.id;
    this.isOver = data.isOver;
    this.createAt = data.createAt;
    this.randomSeed = data.randomSeed;
    this.players = data.players;
}

function Player(data) {
    this.id = data.id;
    this.name = data.name;
}

var playerFactory = factory(function (name) {
    var id = this.sequence();
    name = name || 'Player ' + id;
    return new Player({
        id: id,
        name: name
    });
});

var gameFactory = factory(function () {
    var players = playerFactory.create(2);
    players.push(playerFactory('Awesome player'));
    return new Game({
        id: this.sequence(),
        isOver: false,
        createAt: new Date(),
        randomSeed: Math.random(),
        players: players
    });
});
```

You can now build a new game the following way:

``` js
var game = gameFactory();
```

which returns a Game instance with the following data:

``` js
id: 0,
isOver: true,
createdAt: Wed Apr 03 2013 21:56:16 GMT+0200 (CEST),
randomSeed: 0.672447538934648,
players: [
    { id: 0, name: 'Player 0' },
    { id: 1, name: 'Player 1' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Awesome player' }
]
```
    
### Create a new factory

You create a new factory the following way: 

``` js
var personFactory = factory(function (name) {
    return new Person({ name: (name || 'Person') + this.sequence() });
});
```

This effectively binds the given function to a factory instance that
provides support for sequencing. Furthermore the given function is
decorated with methods for creating multiple instances and reset the
sequence of the factory.

### Creating an instance using the factory

You create a new instance by calling the factory:

``` js
var person0 = personFactory();
var person1 = personFactory();
```

<tt>person0</tt> will be named <i>Person0</i> and <tt>person1</tt> will
be named <i>Person1</i>.

### Creating multiple instances using the factory

You can create multiple instances using the create method on the factory:

``` js
var persons = personFactory.create(2);
```

This will create a persons array containing two persons.
<tt>person[0]</tt> will be named <i>Person0</i> and <tt>person[1]</tt>
will be named <i>Person1</i>.

All additional arguments to create will be forwarded to the factory method:

``` js
var persons = personFactory.create(2, 'Human');
```

This will create a persons array containing two persons.
<tt>person[0]</tt> will be named <i>Human0</i> and <tt>person[1]</tt>
will be named <i>Human1</i>.

### Parameterized factories

You can parameterize you factory the following way:

``` js
var personFactory = factory(function (name) {
    name = name || 'Person' + this.sequence();
    return new Person({ name: name });
});
```

When you call the personFactory with a name it will return a person
with that name; otherwise it will default to the sequenced name.

``` js
var person0 = personFactory();
var person1 = personFactory('foo');
```

<tt>person0</tt> will be named <i>Person0</i> and <tt>person1</tt> will
be named <i>Foo</i>.

If you use the <tt>create</tt> method to create multiple instances it
call the factory method with no parameters.

### Combining factory methods

You are free to combine factory methods as you are pleased. But be
aware not to create cyclic recursion.
    
``` js
var dogFactory = factory(function () {
    return new Dog({ name: 'Dog' + this.sequence() });
});

var personFactory = factory(function () {
    return new Person({ 
        name: 'Person' + this.sequence(), 
        dog: dogFactory();
    });
});
```
    
Every person you create with the personFactory will have a dog
instance associated.

``` js
var person0 = personFactory();
var person1 = personFactory();

assert(person0.name === 'Person0');
assert(person0.dog.name === 'Dog0');

assert(person1.name === 'Person1');
assert(person1.dog.name === 'Dog1');
```

### Resetting the sequence of a factory

You can reset the sequencing of a factory the following way:

``` js
var personFactory = factory(function () {
    return new Person({ name: 'Person' + this.sequence() });
});

var person0 = personFactory();
personFactory.reset();
var person1 = personFactory();
```

<tt>person0</tt> will be named <i>Person0</i> and <tt>person1</tt>
will be named <i>Person0</i>.
